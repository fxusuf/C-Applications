# C Applications Repository 

printf("Building the foundation...\n"); 
This repository contains a variety of projects written in the C programming language. Each project focuses on solving a specific problem or implementing a particular algorithm.

## Projects
1. **[Factorial Calculator](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Factorial%20Calculator)**: Calculates the factorial of a number, validates input, and displays the calculation steps.
2. **[Football Team Score](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Football%20Team%20Score)**: Tracks a football team's performance by recording goals scored and conceded. Calculates total matches, wins, losses, draws, and points.
3. **[Basic Calculator](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Basic%20Calculator%20App)**: Performs arithmetic operations on two numbers based on user selection, ensuring no division by zero and handling undefined operations gracefully.
4. **[Geometric Area Calculator](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Geometric%20Area%20Calculator)**: Calculates the area of a square, triangle, or circle based on user input, with validation for shape selection and required dimensions.
5. **[Grade Calculator and Evaluation](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Grade%20Calculator%20and%20Evaluation)**:  Calculates the final grade based on midterm, final, and attendance scores. The program assigns a letter grade and specifies whether the student passed or failed, considering conditional success cases.
6. **[Grade Calculator](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Grade%20Calculator)**: Gathers student scores, ensuring valid inputs. Calculates average, identifies the highest and lowest scores, and shows their positions. Stops with a warning if a negative number is entered as the number of grades.
7. **[Guest Age Analysis: Counting and Listing Below-Average Ages](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Guest%20Age%20Analysis%3A%20Counting%20and%20Listing%20Below-Average%20Ages)**: A program calculates the average age of visitors and lists those younger than the average. It also counts how many guests are below average.
8. **[Multiplication Table](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Multiplication%20Table)**: This program creates a 1-10 multiplication table using nested loops, displaying results in a formatted grid with each equation separated by vertical bars.
9. **[Parking Fee Calculator](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Parking%20Fee%20Calculator)**: This C program calculates parking fees based on the duration of stay, validating input and applying different rates for varying time intervals.
10. **[Star Pattern Generator Based on Input Number](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Star%20Pattern%20Generator%20Based%20on%20Input%20Number)**: This C program prints a star pattern based on user input. It uses nested loops to print decreasing rows of stars, starting from the input number down to one.
11. **[Tempreture Calculator](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Tempreture%20Calculator)**: A simple C program to convert temperatures between Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit using modular functions.
12. **[Armstrong Numbers Finder](https://github.com/fxusuf/C-Applications/tree/main/Armstrong%20Numbers%20Finder)**: A program that finds armstrong numbers between 1 to 999.
